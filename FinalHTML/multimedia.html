      Lokah Chapter 1: Chandra (2025) is a Malayalam-language superhero fantasy
      thriller directed by Dominic Arun and produced by Wayfarer Films. The film
      follows Chandra (Kalyani Priyadarshan), a mysterious, goth-style woman who
      moves to Bengaluru to tackle a dark, supernatural, and corrupt force,
      rooted in Kerala folklore. Described as a "vampire-superhero" hybrid, she
      possesses extraordinary abilities and works as a nocturnal courier while
      navigating a world of organized crime. With a focus on intense action,
      stylish visual effects, and a haunting background score, the film serves
      as the opening chapter of a larger, ambitious "Lokah" cinematic universe,
      often praised for its unique, localized, and female-led approach to the
      genre.
